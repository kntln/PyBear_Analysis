# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
PyBer ride sharing data for the year 2019 were analyzed in order to find ways to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. Data visualization in the form of pie chart and line graph were created to assist in drawing valid conclusions from the data. Specifically, in this analysis the following information were generated:
- Percentage of Total Fares by City Type
- Percentage of Total Rides by City Type
- Percentage of Total Drivers by City Type
- Total Weekly Fare by City type

## Results
In this section, each components of the results generated from the analysis will be discussed in detail but the figure below illustrates the overview of the PyBer ride sharing data for the year 2019 by comparing the total number of rides per city and the average fare. Based on the figure, the average fare tends to be higher in rural cities compared to urban cities. In addition, the total number of rides are a lot lower in rural cities in contrast with urban cities, while the average fare and total number of rides in suburban cities tend to cluster in the middle.

### Percentage of Total Fares by City Type
As evident from the figure below, urban cities had the highest percentage of total fares by city type which is 62.7% followed by suburban cities which had 30.5% and lastly, rural cities which had 6.8%.

### Percentage of Total Rides by City Type
The percentage of total rides by city type exhibit the same pattern as the result described above. Specifically, urban cities yielded the highest number of total rides which is 68.4%. Suburban cities generated 26.3% of total rides while rural had 5.3%.

### Percentage of Total Drivers by City Type
A pronounced differences by city type was captured in the percentage of total drivers analysis as shown in the figure below. 80.9% of drivers are located in urban cities while 16.5% were in suburban and only 2.6% were in rural areas.

### Total Weekly Fare by City type
For this analysis a multiple line chart was created in order to visualize the total weekly fare by city type. As illustrated by the figure below, from the period of January to end of April, urban city had the highest total fare, followed by suburban and lastly, the rural. An interesting pattern to point out is all city types had an increase in revenue during the end of February. In addition, at the start of April both rural and urban cities experienced an increase in total revenue while the suburban city did not. Lastly, at the end of April, the revenue for suburban city was increasing in revenue while the urban city was experiencing a decrease. These patterns were important to note as they can have implications with regards to determining the affordability and increasing access to ride sharing services.

## Summary
To conclude, the analysis yielded useful information to help address the disparities among city type. One recommendation to address this is, increasing the number of drivers in proportion to the population of the city type. As shown on the percentage of total drivers by city type, 80.9% of the drivers are located in urban cities compared to 16.5% in suburban and 2.6% in rural areas. It would be useful to know the population of each city types and adjust the number of drivers to accommodate the number of people in that particular area. By doing so, people in rural and suburban area can experience an increase in access to ride-sharing services and at the same lower the cost for passengers in that area. However, increasing the number of drivers based on population of city type may pose a challenge as some drivers may prefer urban cities due to higher demand, thus the second recommendation would be giving greater incentives to drivers to allow them to offer their services in suburban and rural areas. Giving incentives to drivers can help alleviate the scarcity of the drivers in targeted areas, hence, increasing accessibility. Lastly, another useful recommendation would be further investigating the trends on the total weekly fare multiple line chart. For instance, during the end of February, all city types had an increase in revenue, it would be beneficial to understand the cause of the spike in revenues during this month in order to anticipate for future events. Understanding the cause of the spike will allow the company to properly allocate the resources in order to accommodate the increase in demand of ride sharing services during this time. Moreover, understanding the trends will help the company determine the time to allocate or cut back the resources and therefore maximizing efficiency and profitability.
